# Electric-cars



We’re well aware that you’d rather we built a big car right away, but we’ll be pressed for time and space as well. Nevertheless, three hours will be quite enough for you to learn how to design your own little car, cut it out with a laser cutter and fit it with an electric engine and mechanical parts to transmit power from the engine to the wheels that will set your little car in motion. And finally, we’ll hold a real race where you can put your cars to the test!

You’ll get to take your very own electric car home with you after the workshop is concluded.
